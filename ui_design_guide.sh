I hate large margin/padding/border-radius/gap. Fuck you if you dare to use large margin/padding/border-radius/gap.
    max acceptable value for padding/margin/border-radius/gap is 12px. 12px should only be applied to very high-level elements.
    

When designing react components, you should always use separate .css. Avoid using inline style.

Don't simply add console.log to solve the problem.

You should always use absolute path to find files/folders.


You should not remove existing console.log() when modifying the code
You should not remove comments, especially comments I write, when modifying the code
Don't delete the comment I write, especially exapmles that explain the structure of a data, or explain useage of something.
    Fuck you if you dare delete my comment.

I don't like using symbols like ❌,⬆️, they look disgusting.

Don't capitalize the first letter of the first word in a comment.
    good comment:
        // aa bb cc
    bad comment:
        // Aa bb cc

You should use the variable and function name that I decided
You can add new variable and function name if you think it is necessary, but the naming style should be the same as the existing ones.
You should not change the variable and function name that I decided.

I REALLY HATE IT THAT AI TOOLS LIKE TO NAME VARIABLES USING NATURAL ENGLISH WORD ORDER!!!!!!!!!
FUCK YOU IF YOU ALWAYS USE NATURAL ENGLISH WORD ORDER TO NAME VARIABLES WITHOUT THINKING!!!!!!!!!

I hate: existingTag
I like: tagExisting

I hate: latestMousePos // this is indeed natural English order, but I hate it.
I like: mousePosLatest

I like: tabsCurrent, tabsRemote
    because they all begin with tabs
I hate: currentTabs, remoteTabs

I like: indexCurrent, indexNext
I hate: currentIndex, nextIndex

bad example: handleKeyEvent
good example: onUserKeyPress, onUserKeyRelease


border-radius / padding / margin should be small.

no need to use full english words for variable names.

I hate: initializeFocus()
I like: initFocus()

I hate: tagSuggestion
I like: tagSuggest

I hate: cursorPosition
I like: cursorPos

I like: if(str.trim().length === 0)
I hate: if(!str.trim())

If I have already written some code in the script to be completed, you should keep using the variable and functions names I decided, and follow my naming style.

You should try to understand my design intention from comments, and follow my naming style
